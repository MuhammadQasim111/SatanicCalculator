# 😈 Satanic Calculator – The World’s First Intentionally Wrong Calculator

> ⚠️ *Warning: This calculator lies on purpose.*

---

## 🧠 About the Project

The **Satanic Calculator** is a quirky, creative, and thought-provoking tool that *intentionally gives wrong answers*. It randomly perturbs the correct result to generate flawed outputs and switches between two unpredictable modes: `"LLM"` and `"Tool"`. This project challenges our blind trust in automation and emphasizes the need for critical thinking in an AI-dominated future.

---

## 🌍 Why This Project Matters

As AI tools increasingly shape critical decisions in our lives — from healthcare to finance — this project acts as a **powerful metaphor** for:
- 🧠 **Critical thinking about AI decision-making**
- ⚠️ **Dangers of over-reliance on automated tools**
- 🧪 **Testing human attention to detail and validation skills**
- 🔐 **Encouraging safer, explainable, and auditable AI systems**

This is more than a calculator — it’s a conversation starter on ethics, risk, and AI fallibility.

---

## 🎯 Practical Applications

- 🧑‍🏫 **Education**: Engage students in discussions on AI trust and validation.
- 🎓 **AI Safety Demonstrations**: Show how incorrect outputs can go undetected.
- 💼 **UX Research**: Understand how users handle misleading interfaces.
- 😂 **Satirical Product Demos**: Lighten up serious presentations in AI meetups.
- 🔬 **Fail-Safe Testing**: Train teams to double-check and validate AI outputs.
