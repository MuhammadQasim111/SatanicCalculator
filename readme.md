# 😈 Satanic Calculator – The World’s First Intentionally Wrong Calculator

> ⚠️ Warning: This calculator lies on purpose.

## 🧠 About the Project

The **Satanic Calculator** is a quirky, fun, and thought-provoking project that challenges conventional thinking about computation and automation. Instead of giving correct answers, this AI-based calculator randomly perturbs the correct solution — making it *dangerously wrong*. It operates in two mysterious modes: `"LLM"` and `"Tool"`, adding an unpredictable twist to user interactions.

### 🌍 Why This Project Matters

In a world increasingly driven by AI, blind trust in machine outputs can be dangerous. This project serves as a **powerful metaphor** for:
- 🧪 **Testing AI safety and robustness**
- 🧠 **Promoting critical thinking**
- 🤖 **Educating users about the dark side of over-reliance on AI tools**
- 💻 **Building secure and explainable AI systems**

This is not just a calculator; it’s a **commentary** on our digital future.
